# NYC CitiBike Challenge

## Purpose
The purpose was to analyze data for Citi Bike in New York and utilize that data to determine whether we could have a similar operation be successful in Des Moines. We looked at the month of August as the warmer month would be ideal for riding bikes in both states. We are looking to determine when the bikes are most utilized, the length of time they are checked out for and the demographic information about the users. 

### Analysis
The first graphic shows that Citi Bike is most heavily utilized for short trips as evidenced by checkout times.

This graphic shows males are by far the most frequent users of Citi Bikes.

The next graphic shows bike trips by weekday. You can see the busiest times align with commutes to and from work.

This one shows bike trips by gender. Similar patterns throughout the week day, just more heavily utilized by males. Weekends show more consistent usage throughout the day.

Next we take a look at user trips by gender by weekday comparing subscribers to new clientele.

As expected we can see that the younger the person is who checked out a bike, the longer their typical trip duration was.

Finally, you can see the peak hours for the month of August.

#### Summary
As you can see visualized here, there are more subscribers that utilize bike rentals than non-subscribers. There are far more men that rent bikes than women and there is heavier usage around commute hours for a typical work day. This data represents a very large population in New York City so to draw a similar comparison for Des Moines we may need more data around the types of places visited for travelers. For those subscribers how far was their commute and how far in comparison is their home from the nearest rental facility. These would be important things to understand for determining viability for any future development in other cities.
